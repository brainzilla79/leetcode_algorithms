# Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

# According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

# Given the following binary tree:  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]

#         _______3______
#        /              \
#     ___5__          ___1__
#    /      \        /      \
#    6      _2       0       8
#          /  \
#          7   4
# Example 1:

# Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The LCA of of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
# Example 2:

# Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself
#              according to the LCA definition.
# Note:

# All of the nodes' values will be unique.
# p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.
